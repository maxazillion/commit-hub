#Description
`This app uses the git hub API to collect and display
commit messages for this app. The carousel can be clicked through
to see the whole range of the commit messages. There is a counter on
the bottom to display current and total messages`

#Technology
`This was a react boot strap application. It uses Axios for the api call. It uses
components from the bootstrap library.`

#Improvements
`I will work on this project a little more. I think making a carousel by hand
wasn't the best idea in terms of ascetics however it was fun. The git hub
API was easy to use and contained a lot of information that I chose not to display
in favor of time. In the future I think I will come back to this and make it a little
more capable. I think having the carousel auto rotate and clicks display more
information in a modal would be nice. Also, it would be really easy to make the site
take user names and repos as arguments so the program could be more adaptable. Lastly
I may parse the commit string to new line on all of the hash marks.`

#To hiring manager
`Thank you for your consideration. If you'd like me to go further beyond MVP and
follow through on the improvement section, just let me know. I couldn't spend as much
time as I wanted to this and get it into you today with my current job taking my
resources. Thank you for the consideration`
